/*Lucy developed a library class that contains main constants and methods for all
projects in her company, but, unfortunately, they have unclear names and meanings.
Write code that prints values of constants and results of both methods in the
following order: A_CONSTANT_TTT, B_CONSTANT_QQQ, getMagicString(),
convertStringToAnotherString("aa"). Each value must be printed in a new line.
Use the provided template. The class with constants and methods will be available
during testing.*/

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Task 1 : " + ConstantAndUtilities.A_CONSTANT_TTT );
        System.out.println("Task 2 : " + ConstantAndUtilities.B_CONSTANT_QQQ);
        System.out.println("Task 3 : " + ConstantAndUtilities.getMagicString());
        System.out.println("Task 4 : " + ConstantAndUtilities.convertStringToAnotherString("abc"));
