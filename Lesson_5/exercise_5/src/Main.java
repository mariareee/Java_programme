/* Task:
Residents of the country of Malevia often experiment with the plan of their rooms.
        Rooms can be triangular, rectangular, and round. Write a program that calculates the
        floorage of the rooms.
        Input data format: The type of the room shape and the relevant parameters.
        Output data format: The area of the resulting room.
        Note that the value of 3.14 is used instead of the number Ï€ in Malevia

        Note, the input values (a, b, c, r) are doubles and your answer should be, too.
