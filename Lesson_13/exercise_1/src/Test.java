/*Find a mistake
* You've decided to create your own project and for that, you need to employ 1
programmer and 1 team lead. You have written the code for that, but it does not work.
Your task is to find a mistake.
Advice: what methods can be inherited?
Note: don't rename methods or create your own classes and don't create new
objects. Don't use super and this.*/
