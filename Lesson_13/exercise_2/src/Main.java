/*You are given four classes â€” Publication, Newspaper, Article and
Announcement. You need to override methods getType() and getDetails() in
classes inherited from the class Publication.

and getDetails(). The method should return a String with a type of publication
in the first place, then details in round brackets and the title after a colon.
Examples are shown below. Input is creating an object and giving parameters as
listed below. And output is when calling the getInfo() method through Publication
reference.

Sample Output 1: Publication: The new era
Sample Input 2: Newspaper; Football results; Sport news
Sample Output 2: Newspaper (source - Sport news): Football results
Sample Input 3: Article; Why the Sun is hot; Dr James Smith

Sample Input 4: Announcement; Will sell a house; 30
